/*
Euclid's Algorithm for Computing the GCD of two integers

Given two integers, x and y, their GCD (greatest common divisor) can be calculated recursively using Euclid's Algorithm, which essentially says that if x equals y, then GCD(x,y)=x; otherwise, GCD(x,y)=GCD(x−y,y) if x>y. Note that this logic can be further optimized for a more efficient implementation.

Given the starter code in your editor, complete the function body so it returns the GCD of two input integers, x and y.

Input Format

Two space-separated integers, x and y.

Constraints
1≤x,y≤106

Output Format

Print the GCD of x and y as an integer.

Sample Input

1 5

Sample Output

1

Explanation

We are given x=1 and y=5. This explanation uses the subtraction implementation mentioned in the problem description, and is outlined in pseudocode below:

int GCD(x,y):
    If x equals y, return x;
    Else, return GCD(x',y'), where x' = MAX(x,y) - MIN(x,y) and y' = MIN(x,y).

GCD(1,5): 1≠5, so return a call to GCD(5−1,1).
GCD(4,1): 4≠1, so return a call to GCD(4−1,1).
GCD(3,1): 3≠1, so return a call to GCD(3−1,1).
GCD(2,1): 2≠1, so return a call to GCD(2−1,1).
GCD(1,1): 1=1, so we return x (which is 1).

The final return is passed back through the call stack as the return value for the original call. That is to say, GCD(1,1) returns 1 to GCD(2,1), the function that originally called it. GCD(2,1) then returns it to GCD(3,1), which returns it to GCD(4,1), which returns it to GCD(1,5). Thus GCD(1,5) returns a value of 1, which we print as our answer.

Note: The algorithm used here is merely demonstrative and can be further optimized.
